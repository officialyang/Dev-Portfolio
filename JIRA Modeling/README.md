# JIRA Modeling
*Owned by Principal Financial Group*

**Technologies Used:** Python, KMeans, XGBoost, Random Forest

For the intern project we were tasked to find out prediction time for future JIRA tickets based on historical data. In the JIRA Created & Resolved Dates.pynb file, I wrangled and pre-processed the data into a correct format, including calculating the time difference between created & resolved dates. In the JIRA Sprint Data - Random Forest & XGB.pynb file, I first clustered the datapoints with the KMeans algorithm, and trained each cluster through either the Random Forest or XGBoost Regression Models. These models were then used to predict future ticket time durations.

To use this application, open the files in the Jupyter Notebook IDE and run the cells.
