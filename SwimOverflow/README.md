# SwimOverflow

**Technologies Used:** React, Firestore

Using React as SwimOverflow's web framework, I created SwimOverflow as a platform where the swim community can come online to discuss all types of swim-related discussions, including NCAA, Olympics, and private lessons. And with login functionality, registered users can chat with other members, post various discussion threads, and include comments under each story. Finally, the site keeps track of popularity by updating the number of views on each post, providing a way of ordering under the home and search pages. All the data is stored using the non-relational database Firestore. 

To use this application, *npm start* and the application should load automatically in a new browser.
