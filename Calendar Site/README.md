**Technologies Used:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL

For this project, I created a calendar website where a user could log into and out of the website, create/edit/delete events that would be updated appropriately on the month display, and interact with the calendar UI by traversing through different months, all without refreshing the page. To do this, we implemented JavaScript for the client side, PHP & mySQL for the server side, HTML/CSS for the basic web structure/design, and AJAX requests to allow these functionalities without reloading the page each time. Some creative components that were implemented include flagging events with a certain flag, sharing events with other users, and writing notes for each event.
