This repository is a highlight of the various development projects that I've contributed to throughout the past two years. There is a mix of web, mobile, desktop, and data applications, all of which utilize a diverse array of technologies and skill sets. Feel free to reach out to me if there are any questions or suggestions!

## Projects
1. **C++ Calendar**
- This C++ application provides a calendar interface in which a user can interact with a calendar in different views, from day to year views, and with various actions, including adding events, saving calendars, and restoring previous calendars.
2. **Calendar Site**
 - Like the previous application, this application provides a month-to-month calendar view in which the user can add and remove events. Additionally, this site leverages MySQL databases and AWS so that it can be globally usable.
3. **JIRA Modeling**
 - At my internship with Principal Financial Group, I was tasked with using JIRA data to form a model that could predict how long an issue would take. These Jupyter Notebooks showcase how the data was wrangled, analyzed, and applied with machine learning to accomplish this objective.
4. **Splash**
 - Splash is an iOS application (made with Swift) that maps out the bathrooms and water fountains near your location. This mobile app, which currently has Washington University's data, provides utility for students that need to find the closest bathroom.
5. **SwimOverflow**
 - SwimOverflow is a community-based website that welcomes swimmers and fans of the sport to discuss various swimming-related topics. This website provides account and chat functionality, and was created with React and Firestore.
6. **Tic-Tac-Toe & Gomoku**
 - Built with C++ and OOP principles, this project provides a user interface for tic-tac-toe or gomoku lovers who can play until conclusion (win, loss, or draw).
