# C++ Calendar
Technologies Used: C++

This application dealt with creating a calendar interface in which a user can interact with it in many different ways. Many aspects of object-oriented programming, like class hierarchy and design patterns, and separation of concerns were applied here. The interface contains levels from years, to months, to days, and to events/todo lists, and the user can select which display they would like to see. The user can also commit actions including adding events, saving the calendar, and restoring it back.

To use this application, build an executable file and run it in a command line interface.
