# Splash

**Technologies Used:** Xcode, Swift, Firestore

Splash is an application that navigates WashU students to the nearby bathrooms and water fountains around campus. Additionally, users can rate a bathroom/water fountain and provide written reviews. Possibly the most useful function is the "SOS" button which identifies the nearest bathroom to the current location. The goal was to provide an interactive way to make student's way easier, all while providing a light-hearted crowd-sourced platform.

To use this application, run it on Xcode or sideload it to an iPhone.
