# Tic-Tac-Toe & Gomoku

**Technologies Used:** C++

This application uses C++ in tandem with Object-Oriented Programming principles to create a game interface where the user can play either tic-tac-toe or gomoku. The application first prompts the user to select which game. Then the user can verse their friend in a fun game of tic-tac-toe or gomoku by placing their piece in a certain position until there is a win/loss (3-in-a-row or 5-in-a-row respectively) or a draw (no more spots available).

To use this application, build the files and run the executable file.
